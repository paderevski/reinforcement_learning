# Reinforcement Learning Unit, TJHSST

*Goal* Students will solve some classic RL problems and learn about exploration vs. exploitation, the Bellman equation, solving with perfect knowledge and solving by exploration.

*Content* The units are: Multi-arm bandit (approximate multiple distributions by random sampling), The Gambler's Problem (optimize the Bellman equation with complete knowledge), Gambler's Problem Exploration (find the optimum value by repeated playout and Monte Carlo sampling. (Note: a better MC problem might be Blackjack -- this is TBD)
